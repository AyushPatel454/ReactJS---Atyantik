# Tanstack Query in React.js

Tanstack Query is a powerful library for managing server-state in your React.js applications. It provides a simple and intuitive way to fetch, cache, and update data from your API endpoints. With features like automatic caching, background refetching, and pagination support, Tanstack Query simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications.

## Installation

To use Tanstack Query in your React.js project, you first need to install it along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query react-query
```
or
```bash
yarn add @tanstack/react-query react-query
```
# Example usages
### 1. Setting Up Query Client
Before using Tanstack Query hooks, you need to set up a `QueryClientProvider` at the root of your application to provide a context for managing queries.
```javascript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.render(
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <App />
  </QueryClientProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### 2. Fetching Data with `useQuery`

The `useQuery` hook is used to fetch data from an API endpoint. It automatically handles caching, re-fetching, and updating the data.
```javascript
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function Todos() {
  const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["some-unique-key"], 
    queryFn: fetchTodos,
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (isError) return <div>Error fetching data</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((todo) => (
        <div key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

async function fetchTodos() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/todos");
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Error fetching data");
  }
  return response.json();
}
```

### 3. Providing Additional Configuration
You can provide additional configuration options to the useQuery hook, such as caching duration, polling interval, or stale time.
```javascript
const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery("todos", fetchTodos, {
  cacheTime: 60000, // Cache data for 1 minute
  staleTime: 300000, // Fetch new data if cached data is older than 5 minutes
  refetchInterval: 5000, // Refetch data every 5 seconds
});
```

## Benefits
- **Automatic Caching**: Tanstack Query automatically caches fetched data, reducing the need for manual caching logic.
- **Background Refetching**: Data is automatically refetched in the background to keep it up-to-date.
- **Pagination Support**: Easily implement pagination for large datasets with built-in support.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Perform optimistic updates to UI state while waiting for server responses.

## Conclusion
Tanstack Query simplifies data fetching and state management in React.js applications by providing a powerful set of tools for managing server-state. With its intuitive API and powerful features, it's an excellent choice for handling complex data requirements in modern web applications.
