# Node.js Project with Redux

This project uses Node.js and Redux. Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

## Step 1: Create a Node.js Project

Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Step 2: Install Redux

Next, install the Redux library into your project. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install redux
```

## Step 3: Execute the script

Now, you can run your redux-demo.js script with Node.js. Use the following command:

```bash
node redux-demo.js
```

This command executes the redux-demo.js file using Node.js. Make sure to run this command in the directory where your redux-demo.js file is located.
