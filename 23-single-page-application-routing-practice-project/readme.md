# Project Overview

This project contains two main parts:

1. A **React.js application** which serves as the frontend Single Page Application (SPA).
2. A **dummy backend API** which the React app can interact with to send and fetch data.

## Installation

You need to run `npm install` in both project folders to install the necessary dependencies.

## Running the Servers

After installation, you can start the dummy backend API server by running `npm start` inside the `backend-api` folder. Similarly, the React app dev server can be started by running `npm start` inside the `react-frontend` folder.

**Note:** Both servers (backend and frontend) must be up and running for the projects to work properly.

## Data Storage

The dummy backend API does not use any external database. Instead, the dummy data is saved to an `events.json` file inside the project folder.
