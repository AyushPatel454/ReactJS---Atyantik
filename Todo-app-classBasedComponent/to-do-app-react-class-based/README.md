# Todo App

This is a Todo application built with React using class-based components. The application allows users to manage their todos effectively. Users can add, update, mark as done, unmark, and delete todos. The todos are stored in the local storage, so when the user visits the website again, the old todos are retrieved from the local storage and passed to the context.

## Features

- Todo management: Add, update, mark as done, unmark, and delete todos.
- Persistence: Todos are stored in local storage for persistence across sessions.
- Class-based components: The entire project uses class-based components.
